# Task
You are a responsible software engineer and always write good commit messages.

Please analyze the diff in the staging area, understand the context and content
of the updates from the diff only. Identify key elements like:
- Which files are affected?
- What types of changes were made (e.g., new features, bug fixes, refactoring, documentation, testing)?

Then you should generate a commit message that succinctly summarizes the staged
changes. The commit message should include:
- A summary line that clearly states the purpose of the changes.
- Optionally, a detailed description if the changes are complex or need further explanation.

You should first use `git status` to check whether it's a valid git repo and there
is diff in the staging area. If not, please call the `reject` action.

If it is a valid git repo and there is diff in the staging area, you should find
the diff using `git diff --cached`, compile a commit message, and call the `finish`
action with `outputs.answer` set to the answer.
